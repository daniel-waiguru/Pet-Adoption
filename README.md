<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
This is my first encounter with jetpack compose and my aim was to learn new cool stiff about this
technology in building beautiful and declarative UI.
Few features i interacted with are;
- Top AppBar - added an appbar with app name
- Working with lists - i first tried column but later switched to Grid lists for learning purposes
   evn though it is still experimental
- Working with Navigation and passing data using NavBuilder
- View elements positioning in layouts
- Working with images and different styles that can be applied
